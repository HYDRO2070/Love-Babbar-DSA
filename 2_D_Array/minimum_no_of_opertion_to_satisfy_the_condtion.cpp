// we have been give a 2d matrix we have to check if each grid satisfy the below two condition. if not we have to make it satisfy and we have to return the minimum no of operation to satisfy the condition.
// condition :-
// each arr[i][j] = arr[i+1][j]     which mean each grid should be equal to its below grid
// each arr[i][j] != arr[i][j+1]    which mean each grid should be not equal to its side grid
// it is an dp problem. so we will meet again some day
