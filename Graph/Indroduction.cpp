// A graph is a type of data structure which is combination of edge and Node.
// node - an entite which store the data.
// edge - which connect the node.
// path - a path is the node throught the (A) point have to travel to reach the (B) point. IN a path nodes can be repeated.
// degree - the no. of egdes from a node.(in directed graph there two degree which is in degree and out degree)
// type of graph - (there can be combination of more than two graph like weighted underected graph)
    // undirected graph - there is no direction in edge
    // directed graph - there are direction on edge.
    // weighted graph - a graph which have some weight on the edges.
    // Cyclic graph - if a graph have a path which start from a node and end on the same node than it is cyclic graph.
    // Acyclic graph - reverse of cyclic graph. means which dont have a pth which start and end on the same node.
// graph representaion - 
    // Adjacency matrix - in this we use 2D matrix to represent the graph.
    // Adjacency list
