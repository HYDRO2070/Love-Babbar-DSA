// Catalan numbers are defined as a mathematical sequence that consists of positive integers, which can be used to find the number of possibilities of various combinations. 

// The nth term in the sequence denoted Cn, is found in the following formula: 
// (2n)!((n+1)!n!)
              
// ((n+1)!n!)(2n)!​  

// The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are : 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …  

// Catalan numbers occur in many interesting counting problems like the following.

// Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses that are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
// Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
// Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
// Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points such that no 2 chords intersect.
// See this for more applications. 

// Examples:

// Input: n = 6
// Output: 132


// Input: n = 8
// Output: 1430
